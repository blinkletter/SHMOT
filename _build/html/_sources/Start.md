# SHMOT

## Preface

This book presents a brief introduction to **simplified Hückel molecular orbital theory (SHMOT)**. We will examine the **assumptions** and simplifications that are used to make a simplified representation of a **&pi; molecular orbital system**. Then we will introduce the diagonalized matrix method for **solving** the secular equations. After that, we will turn to the practical matters of using a computer to do all that work for us. You will be introduced to using *Python* commands to determine the **eigenvectors and eigenvalues**. Finally, we will use a HMOT package available from the internet that will make everything **easier**.

## Outline

### 1. [HMO Theory](Basics)

**Introduction** to HMOT and the matrix method

### 2. [HMOT with *Python*](Intro_to_HMOT)

Using *Python* to build the **interaction matrix** in a conjugated &pi; system and calculate the **energies** of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding atomic orbital **coefficients**

### 3. [HMOT with Polarity](Polar_Atoms_HMOT)

Including **adjustments** in the interaction matrix to account for **differences** in **electronegativity** between atoms.

### 4. [HückelSolver](SHMO_Github_tool)

Using the **HuckelSolver package** to obtain information from HMOT systems. Future calculations will **use** the HückelSolver tool.

### 5. [An Example](benzene_cation)

Using the HuckelSolver package to calculate the **molecular orbitals** and partial **charges** in the benzyl cation.
