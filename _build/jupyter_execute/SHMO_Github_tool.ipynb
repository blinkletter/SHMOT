    "Never reinvent the wheel. I am willing to bet that every *Python* program that you plan to make has **already** been written. Randal Taylor has **written** a *Python* class library that provides tools for **calculating** parameters of SHMO systems. The code can be obtained [here](https://github.com/randlet/SHMO)\n",

    "A *class* is a **data object** that includes **functions** within it that can operate on the data that it contains. Imagine a **container** that can hold a number but also includes functions for incrementing and decrementing the number by a set value. This could all be wrapped into a **class** rather than a variable and two separate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the class function, you **create** an object with that class (it has all the properties of the class). This is the heart of \"**object oriented programming**\". We don't care about that, we're just going to use it.\n"

    "To start, ensure that the `shmo.py` file is located in the **same directory** as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We **create** a HuckelSolver **object** by calling the `HuckelSolver()` class function. We provide the Hückel interaction **matrix** and the **number** of $\\pi$ electrons. The command `z = HuckelSolver(Array, Number)` will create the object `z` that contains all the Huckel **parameters** for the system defined by the interaction matrix `Array` with `Number` $\\pi$ electrons. `Array` may be any \"array-like\" object. It can be a list of lists, a *NumPy* array or a *NumPy* matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the HuckelSolver object is created from the data, the following **properties** may be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data`\n",
    "    - This is the **connection matrix** that was input into the HuckelSolver class function that created the object being queried. \n",
    "- `.num_electrons`\n",
    "    - An integer for the **number** of electrons that were used in the creation of the HuckelSolver object.\n",
    "- `.energies`\n",
    "    - a *NumPy* array of the **eigenvalues**. These are the relative orbital energies.\n",
    "- `.eigen_vectors`\n",
    "    - a list of *NumPy* arrays. Each item in the list is a *NumPy* array with orbital **coefficients** for the corresonding energy in `.energies`. For example, `.eigen_vectors[2]` is the array of coefficients for the orbital with the energy in `.energies[2]`. Each **array** is ordered according to atoms. So `.eigen_vectors[2][0]` is the coefficient on the first (0<sup>th</sup>) atom in the array for the orbital in position 2 of the list (which is the 3<sup>rd</sup> orbital, remember all *Python* lists and arrays begin at position \"0\").\n",
    "- `.charge_densities`\n",
    "    - A *NumPy* array of the $\\pi$ electron density on each atom.\n",
    "- `.net_charges`\n",
    "    - A *NumPy* array of the net charge (due to $\\pi$ electrons) on each atom.\n",
    "- `.bond_orders`\n",
    "    - a *NumPy* matrix with bond orders. Look to the cells that **correspond** to bonds to get the order of the $\\pi$ bond between the two referenced atoms. e.g. cell 2,3 will contain the bon order between atoms 2 and atom 3. cells that do not reference bonds contain values but are not important.\n",
    "- `.energy_eigens`\n",
    "    - This is a **combination** of `.energies` and `.energies`. It is a list of lists for each orbital. Each sublist contains the orbital energy and the corresponding array of eigenvectors.\n",
    "- `.populated_levels`\n",
    "    - This is a subclass that contains **three types of data**. It is a list of data for each orbital. Each orbital is represented by an object that contains the energy (of the given molecular orbital), eigenvector (orbital coefficients at each atom) and the number of electrons in the orbital.\n",
