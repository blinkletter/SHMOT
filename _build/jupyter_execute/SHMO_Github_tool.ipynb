    "\n",
    "We **create** a HuckelSolver **object** by calling the `HuckelSolver()` class function. We provide the H端ckel interaction **matrix** and the **number** of $\\pi$ electrons. The command `z = HuckelSolver(Array, Number)` will create the object `z` that contains all the Huckel **parameters** for the system defined by the interaction matrix `Array` with `Number` $\\pi$ electrons. `Array` may be any \"array-like\" object. It can be a list of lists, a *NumPy* array or a *NumPy* matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the HuckelSolver object is created from the data, the following **properties** may be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data`\n",
    "    - This is the **connection matrix** that was input into the HuckelSolver class function that created the object being queried. \n",
    "- `.num_electrons`\n",
    "    - An integer for the **number** of electrons that were used in the creation of the HuckelSolver object.\n",
    "- `.energies`\n",
    "    - a *NumPy* array of the **eigenvalues**. These are the relative orbital energies.\n",
    "- `.eigen_vectors`\n",
    "    - a list of *NumPy* arrays. Each item in the list is a *NumPy* array with orbital **coefficients** for the corresonding energy in `.energies`. For example, `.eigen_vectors[2]` is the array of coefficients for the orbital with the energy in `.energies[2]`. Each **array** is ordered according to atoms. So `.eigen_vectors[2][0]` is the coefficient on the first (0<sup>th</sup>) atom in the array for the orbital in position 2 of the list (which is the 3<sup>rd</sup> orbital, remember all *Python* lists and arrays begin at position \"0\").\n",
    "- `.charge_densities`\n",
    "    - A *NumPy* array of the $\\pi$ electron density on each atom.\n",
    "- `.net_charges`\n",
    "    - A *NumPy* array of the net charge (due to $\\pi$ electrons) on each atom.\n",
    "- `.bond_orders`\n",
    "    - a *NumPy* matrix with bond orders. Look to the cells that **correspond** to bonds to get the order of the $\\pi$ bond between the two referenced atoms (e.g., cell 2,3 will contain the bond order between atoms 2 and atom 3). Cells that do not reference bonds contain values but are not important.\n",
    "- `.energy_eigens`\n",
    "    - This is a **combination** of `.energies` and `.energies`. It is a list of lists for each orbital. Each sublist contains the orbital energy and the corresponding array of eigenvectors.\n",
    "- `.populated_levels`\n",
    "    - This is a subclass that contains **three types of data**. It is a list of data for each orbital.
